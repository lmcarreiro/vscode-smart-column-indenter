# Smart Column Indenter

This extension adds support for indenting code into columns, to make your code more beautiful, readable, clear and with fewer lines of code.

The work is in progress at the github repository: https://github.com/lmcarreiro/smart-column-indenter

## Features

1. **Indent into 2 Columns (Ctrl+I Ctrl+J)** Used in key-value pair which the values aren't similar.
2. **Indent into N Columns (Ctrl+I Ctrl+N)** Used in a sequence of two or more lines that are similar
3. **Remove Line Breaks (Ctrl+I Ctrl+I)** Used to remove line breaks (normally in object literals)

## Limitations

Feel free to make Pull Requests to add support to other languages and add new features.
